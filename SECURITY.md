# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This angular app is currently in pre-release state. That means changes can
occur frequently and only the latest released version will be supported with
security and bug fixes. It is therefore not recommended to use this app in
productive environments.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please contact the author team directly via
[email](package.json). Pull-requests with proposed solutions are explicitly
welcomed as well.
